Mooch Runner dApp: The Decentralized Meme Competition

---------------------------------üöÄ Overview------------------------------

Mooch Runner is a cutting-edge decentralized application (dApp) built for the vibrant world of crypto memes. It provides a unique platform for users to submit, vote on, and earn rewards from the most engaging and viral memes of the day. Our mission is to foster community engagement and reward creativity within the decentralized space.

‚ú® Core Features

------------------------üñºÔ∏è Meme Submission----------------------------------

Unleash Creativity: Users can submit their original and funniest memes, providing a ticker, title, optional description, and a Twitter (X) link.

Cost to Submit: Each meme submission has a nominal cost (e.g., 100 $MOOCH), ensuring quality and commitment from creators.

Phase-Based: Meme submissions are open for a 1-hour period within each cycle. When submissions are closed, an interactive animation signals the current status.

--------------------------------üó≥Ô∏è Meme Voting & Engagement----------------------------------------
Daily Voting Cycles: Users can browse a gallery of submitted memes and vote for their favorites.

Voting takes place over a 22-hour period following the submission phase.

Flexible Voting: Users can choose how many votes they wish to cast (e.g., 1 $MOOCH per vote).

Real-time Feedback: Voting triggers an immediate "YOU'VE BEEN MOOCH'D!" animation, enhancing user experience.

Trending & Activity: Dedicated sections showcase trending memes (based on votes) and a live activity feed displaying recent votes and submissions.

Winner Rewards: The meme chosen as the winner of a cycle receives 0.5% of the total token supply.

Launching on Arena App: After the voting phase, the winning meme proceeds to a 1-hour launch period on the Arena App, where it becomes immediately available for trading and otc on moochrunner platform.

üí∞ Wallet & Earn Rewards

Our integrated wallet system goes beyond simple balances, offering earning opportunities and outlining the dApp's economic model:

-------------------------Your Wallet-------------------------------------------------

Portfolio Overview: View your total portfolio value, along with current holdings of $MOOCH and AVAX.

Claim Testnet $MOOCH: Easily acquire mock $MOOCH tokens to participate in the dApp.

Transaction History: A detailed log of all your voting, submission, and swap activities, including $MOOCH spent and its equivalent USD value.

Your Points: Track your accumulated points, earned by spending $MOOCH on voting and submissions.

Weekly APR: See your calculated weekly APR (%) based on your earned points, reflecting your potential earnings from the rewards pool.

------------------------------Earn $AVAX----------------------------------------------

AVAX Rewards Pool: A transparent pool (e.g., 1000 AVAX) allocated for community rewards.

A percentage of the AVAX generated from OTC sales is directly added to this reward pool and distributed weekly based on users' accumulated points from $MOOCH spent on the platform.

Community Points: The overall dApp's total accumulated points from all users determine the total rewards pool emission rate.

Claim Mechanism: A clear "Claim" button allows users to claim their share of AVAX rewards, calculated based on their individual points versus the total community points. Claimed AVAX is added to your personal balance and deducted from the pool.

---------------------------------üí± OTC / Swap-------------------------------------------------------------------

Discounted Swaps: Acquire $MOOCH or other "launched" meme coins (tokens that were top runners in previous cycles) at a 10% discount from their mocked current market price.

Available Supply: A mocked total supply is available for OTC swaps (e.g., 100,000,000 $MOOCH).

Tokenomics Integration: 50% of all $MOOCH spent through votes and meme submissions is channeled into the OTC mechanism. This portion of $MOOCH is strategically sold via OTC to generate funds used to launch and buy up the supply of coins/tokens that emerge as "runners of the day" from our app. This creates a sustainable loop, rewarding top memes and supporting their market presence.

NFT Holder Exclusive Access: A percentage of the $MOOCH available through OTC sales is reserved exclusively for users holding a Mooch NFT, allowing them to purchase at an even greater discount.

Transaction Details: After a swap, receive mock details including the transaction hash (with explorer link), gas fee, and slippage.

Swap Limit: A simulated limit (e.g., max 100 AVAX per transaction) is in place.

"Yapper" Rewards: A percentage of the funds generated are also reserved for "yappers" ‚Äì dedicated community contributors who champion the "runner of the day" and promote the dApp.

-------------------------------üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack-----------------------------------------------

Frontend: React.js for a dynamic and interactive user interface.

Styling: Custom CSS with inspiration from Tailwind CSS for a distinct retro-futuristic, green-on-black terminal aesthetic.

Animations: CSS Keyframes and JavaScript-driven animations (like the flipping timer and bouncing icon) for a lively user experience.

Web3 Integration (Mocked): All blockchain interactions (wallet connection, token approvals, transactions, IPFS uploads) are currently mocked for demonstration purposes.

-------------------------------------üì± Mobile Compatibility------------------------------
The Mooch Runner dApp is designed with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a firm, static, and user-friendly experience across various devices, including the iPhone 12 Pro Max. The layout dynamically adjusts, preventing horizontal scrolling and ensuring all elements are legible and interactive without manual zooming.

This is a demonstration dApp for UI/UX purposes. All blockchain interactions, token values, reward calculations, and market data are simulated and do not represent real-world assets or transactions.
